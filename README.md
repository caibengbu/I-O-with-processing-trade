# I-O-with-processing-trade

This is a repository for the coding sample from my undergraduate thesis: A Method to Concatenate Multi-regional Input-ouput Tables to Inter-regional Input-output Table with Processing Trade, by Ye Sun and Kunfu Zhu. This R codes prepares China's raw firm-level trade data for the compilation of input-output tables.
